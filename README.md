# QT Basic Calculator

This is a simple calculator application built using the Qt framework. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also provides a history section where previous calculations are displayed.

## Features
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
- Real-time display of inputs and results in a QLineEdit.
- Calculation history section to display previous operations in the format: `2 + 5 = 7`.
- Clear button (`C`) to reset the current input and history.
- Error handling for division by zero.

## How to Use
1. Enter a number using the calculator buttons or keyboard.
2. Select an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Enter the next number and press `=` to display the result.
4. The operation will appear in the history section, and you can continue performing additional calculations.
5. Use the `C` button to reset the current input.
